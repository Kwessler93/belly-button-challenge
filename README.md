# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species (Operational Taxonomic Units or OTUs) are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while others are relatively rare.

The dashboard visualizes this dataset using interactive charts, including a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a metadata display panel. Users can select different test subjects from a dropdown menu to dynamically update the visualizations.

## Features
- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual.

- **Bubble Chart**: Represents the microbial composition with OTU IDs as the x-axis, sample values as the 
y-axis, and marker size indicating abundance.

- **Demographic Info Panel**: Displays metadata about the selected individual.

- **Dynamic Updates**: The dashboard updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- D3.js for data visualization

- Bootstrap for layout styling

- GitHub Pages for deployment
